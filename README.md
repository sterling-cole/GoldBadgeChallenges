# GoldBadgeChallenges
# Komodo Industries
In these challenges I have created three console applications for use within Komodo. Each one making use of a class library, console app, and unit testing.
## Projects
1. Komodo Cafe Menu Manager
2. Komodo Insurance Claims Assistant
3. Komodo Employee Access Manager

## Applicability and Progress

Using the Menu Manager we can add items, remove item, or just see what we got.
Testing passed.

The claims assistant can show you insurance claims and cycle trhough them.
Had trouble applying my logic into code, I could see what it wanted me to do but I had issues executing.

The last project was an employee access manager that allowed you to assign certain badge numbers with access to certain areas.
Did not complete to its full potential. Dictionaries kicked me in the soul and even with the help of an LA I could find no respite from the brutality.
Though I believe the use of a list of strings within the dictionary was logically sound, I again had issues executing.
